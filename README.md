# LwMT-gh-pg-short-code

This is the repository that contains the short version of the Mathematica code that is used in order to observationally constrain a dark energy model that has a rapid transition on the equation of state parameter accompanied by a similar transition on the absolute magnitude. This model is proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. For the full version of the code, please visit [this](https://github.com/GeorgeAlestas/LwMPT) github repository.
